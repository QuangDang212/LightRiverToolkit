I'm welcome any feedback)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this library\r\n1. To simplify and unify the way fetch data from network for developer\r\n2. Developer at the top of a project(usually app developer) keep the same way to get data nomatter service is using http or socket.\r\n\r\nEX:\r\nto fetch data only need three lines of code\r\n\r\n1. Create a service instance and give it a service address\r\n``var getPhotoService = new GetPhotoHttpService(\"http://testgetPhoto.photo.net/photo/get.aspx\");\r\n2. Create parameter that service need which will become in this case GET style url\r\n``var getPhotoParam = new GetPhotoParameter() { PhotoId = \"1\", IsThumbnail = true,};\r\n3. wait for the result\r\n``var photoData = await getPhotoService.InvokeAsync(getPhotoParam);\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can download sourceCode to see demoApp and demoLibrary\r\n\r\nHere're steps to create a Http Service\r\n1. create Data class (in this case class PhotoData)\r\n2. create Parameter class inherit from HttpServiceParameter (in this case class GetPhotoParameter)\r\n3. create Parser class inherit from BaseParser<DataClass, string> (or you can use built-in JsonParser if your data is JSON format)\r\n4. create Service class inherit from BaseHttpService(in this case GetPhotoHttpService)\r\n\r\nHere're steps to create a Socket Service\r\n1. create Data class (in this case class PhotoData)\r\n2. create Parameter class (in this case I take the same class GetPhotoParameter)\r\n3. create Parser class inherit from BaseParser<DataClass, Telegram>\r\n4. create Service class inherit from BaseHttpService(in this case GetPhotoHttpService)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n*1:\r\nIf you want to use Socket.\r\nMake sure download sourceCode and see code inside TelegramSocketConnector, TelegramSocketReceiver and TelegramSocketSender.\r\nBecaure logic in socket would be very diffent in eveyone's need. or You can do this on your own. Maybe this three class\r\nwill remove from toolkit in future release.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
